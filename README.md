Hello everyone , 
Greetings to all
This is my submission for GDSC task for web development 

I tried my best to make the code short and clean , i also tried and made the page responsive using media queries,  well there are many things i wish i could do more in my submission but i couldnt and it isnt about time its about knowledge and exprience , like in the "portfolio" section of website i tried to make those two images get cropped automatically ( side by side ) when on mobile but i failed to do it on the right image and because of that a white margin on whole page is made on the right when on mobile :( . There is a lot more for me to learn here , i hope to learn and grow more and more with gsdc web development team and also solve this image problem i faced too xD .

Thanks
